# CoffeeAndMadness
Ia! Ia! Let's get some coffee.

This is just my project to learn how to start persisting some data to the localStorage, and how to also populate forms, take their input, etc etc.

Nothing fancy, but I am learning some more DOM stunts here. I also have a hideously obvious security hole in this code. Can you spot it?
